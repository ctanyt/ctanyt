I'm a data scientist from Singapore, and this is where I document my learning journey in tech!  

My interests are in computer vision, sustainability (especially marine conservation) and traveltech. 

When I'm taking a break from coding, you can find me exploring the ocean with my camera :diving_mask: 

- Currently working on: Fish species recognition for sustainble fishing in Singapore, Recommender system for alcohol and food
- Reach out for a chat over coffee/beer or to collaborate on any fun projects
